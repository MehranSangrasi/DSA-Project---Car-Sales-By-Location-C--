The program reads data from a CSV file and stores it in memory using C++ data structures. Users can then search and filter the data based on various criteria.


# Structures
- Binary and Tertiary AVLs
- Linked lists
- Hash maps
- 2d Hashes
  
# Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your C++ IDE.
- Build and run the program.

# Usage
Upon running the program, the user is presented with a menu of options. Here are brief descriptions of each option:
